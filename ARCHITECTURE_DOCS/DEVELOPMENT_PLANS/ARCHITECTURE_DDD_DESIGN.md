## 🌐 API ARCHITECTURE DESIGN

### **API Gateway Pattern**
```typescript
JIMBO_API_GATEWAY/
├── authentication/
├── rate-limiting/
├── request-routing/
├── response-aggregation/
└── monitoring/
```

### **Event-Driven Architecture**
```typescript
EventBus: {
  // Business Events
  DashboardUpdated,
  AssetUploaded,
  ClientProjectStarted,
  AgentExecutionCompleted,
  DocumentIndexed,
  UserInteractionLogged,
  
  // System Events
  SystemResourceAlert,
  BackupCompleted,
  SecurityBreach,
  PerformanceThreshold
}
```

### **CQRS Implementation**
```typescript
// Command Side (Write)
interface Commands {
  CreateDashboard,
  UpdateWidget,
  UploadAsset,
  StartProject,
  TrainAgent,
  ExecuteWorkflow
}

// Query Side (Read)
interface Queries {
  GetDashboardView,
  SearchAssets,
  GetClientProjects,
  GetAgentPerformance,
  GetUserAnalytics
}
```

---

## 🔄 INTEGRATION PATTERNS

### **Saga Pattern for Complex Workflows**
```typescript
// Example: Client Project Onboarding Saga
ClientOnboardingSaga {
  1. CreateClientProfile
  2. SetupProjectStructure  
  3. InitializeAssetLibrary
  4. ConfigureAIAgents
  5. SendWelcomeNotification
  
  // Compensation actions for failures
  Compensations: {
    DeleteClientProfile,
    CleanupProjectData,
    RemoveAssetAccess,
    DeactivateAgents
  }
}
```

### **Event Sourcing for Audit Trail**
```typescript
EventStore {
  ClientEvents: [
    ClientCreated,
    ProjectAssigned,
    ContractSigned,
    PaymentReceived
  ],
  AssetEvents: [
    AssetUploaded,
    MetadataUpdated,
    AccessGranted,
    VersionCreated
  ],
  SystemEvents: [
    UserLoggedIn,
    DashboardViewed,
    AgentExecuted,
    BackupPerformed
  ]
}
```

## 🚀 SCALABILITY ARCHITECTURE

### **Microservices Decomposition**
```typescript
Services: {
  // Core Business Services
  BusinessIntelligenceService,
  DigitalAssetService,
  ClientManagementService,
  AIAutomationService,
  KnowledgeService,
  
  // Infrastructure Services  
  AuthenticationService,
  NotificationService,
  FileStorageService,
  SearchService,
  AnalyticsService,
  
  // Integration Services
  ExternalAPIService,
  WebhookService,
  EventProcessingService
}
```

### **Data Architecture**
```typescript
DataStrategy: {
  // Transactional Data
  PostgreSQL: {
    business_intelligence,
    client_management,
    user_management
  },
  
  // Document Data
  MongoDB: {
    knowledge_documents,
    asset_metadata,
    workflow_definitions
  },
  
  // Time Series Data
  InfluxDB: {
    system_metrics,
    user_interactions,
    performance_data
  },
  
  // Search Data
  Elasticsearch: {
    document_search,
    asset_search,
    global_search
  },
  
  // Cache Layer
  Redis: {
    session_cache,
    api_cache,
    real_time_data
  }
}
```

## 🔐 SECURITY ARCHITECTURE

### **Zero Trust Security Model**
```typescript
SecurityLayers: {
  Authentication: "JWT + MFA",
  Authorization: "RBAC + ABAC",
  DataEncryption: "AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit",
  NetworkSecurity: "VPN + Firewall rules",
  APIGateway: "Rate limiting + CORS + CSRF protection",
  AuditLogging: "All actions logged with event sourcing"
}
```

### **Role-Based Access Control**
```typescript
Roles: {
  BusinessOwner: {
    permissions: ["read:all", "write:business", "admin:users"]
  },
  ProjectManager: {
    permissions: ["read:projects", "write:projects", "read:clients"]
  },
  Developer: {
    permissions: ["read:assets", "write:assets", "read:ai-models"]
  },
  AIAgent: {
    permissions: ["execute:workflows", "read:data", "write:results"]
  }
}
```

---

## 📊 MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY

### **Observability Stack**
```typescript
Monitoring: {
  Metrics: "Prometheus + Grafana",
  Logging: "ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)",
  Tracing: "Jaeger for distributed tracing",
  Alerting: "PagerDuty integration",
  
  BusinessMetrics: {
    DashboardUsage,
    AssetUtilization,
    ClientSatisfaction,
    AIAgentPerformance,
    SystemHealth
  }
}
```

## 💡 ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS

### **Technology Stack Rationale**
```typescript
Choices: {
  Backend: "Node.js + Express (JavaScript ecosystem alignment)",
  Frontend: "React + Three.js (3D capabilities)",
  Database: "Multi-model approach (PostgreSQL + MongoDB + Redis)",
  MessageBus: "Redis Streams (lightweight, fast)",
  API: "REST + GraphQL + WebSockets (different use cases)",
  Deployment: "Docker + Kubernetes (scalability)",
  Monitoring: "Prometheus ecosystem (industry standard)"
}
```

### **Design Principles**
1. **Domain-First**: Business logic drives technical decisions
2. **API-First**: All features exposed via well-designed APIs
3. **Event-Driven**: Loose coupling through events
4. **Polyglot Persistence**: Right database for right data
5. **Microservices Ready**: Modular, independently deployable
6. **Security by Design**: Security built into every layer
7. **Observable**: Full visibility into system behavior
